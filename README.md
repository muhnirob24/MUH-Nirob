# Cyber Threat Library - MUH Nirob

This repository contains an extensive, categorized list of **150 types of cyber attacks**, organized into 8 major threat categories. Each entry represents a distinct threat vector with potential to harm digital infrastructure, steal data, or exploit systems.

The goal of this project is to create an open-source, educational, and research-friendly library for understanding modern and advanced cyber threats.
